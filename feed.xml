        <title>My First job experience :)</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;What happens when you don’t understand the things taught by a teacher in the class?

        <title>Buddhi and Gyani</title>
        
          <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A similar type of story was narrated to me by a teacher of mine on the account of me acting an over-smart: Henceforth this &amp;gt;story has been a torchbearer calming me and showing me my height periodically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

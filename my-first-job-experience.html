        <section class="post-content">

            <p>What happens when you don’t understand the things taught by a teacher in the class? You ask your friend to explain and then the miracle happens, the equations which were taught by a highly qualified professional didn’t get into your head but you completely grasp the whole scenario when taught by a person just like you!</p>

<p>This is not the miracle of your friend but the miracle of personalized learning. This is what university students as home tutors provide. Thus, it makes an individual learn better and grow better. Its a very helping tradition, for all the three members, the child, the tutor, and parents. The practice should be encouraged in for a better and interconnected educational society.</p>

<p>I started giving tuitions at my residence to some school going students during the four years of my engineering course. I chose the time slot of 6:30 AM to 9:30 AM and reserved the evenings for my own studies.</p>

<p>It started with just two students and soon reached 30, split into multiple batches. This was the best way where I was revising the stuff I read before, my aptitude and IQ were automatically being revised and polished, in fact, I was indirectly preparing for job interviews. Meanwhile, the fees I got was more than enough as a pocket money. I became financially independent to the most extent and was able to support my expenses including the college fees and books.</p>

<p>It helped me improve not just my IQ and aptitude but also in many other areas like- public speaking, group discussions, soft skills, self-confidence and problem-solving while exchanging questions and answers. And above all was the respect I get from my students as well as their parents. These whole things made me a job ready and guess what it also helped me ace the very first campus placement.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t mention this (“my first job experience”) on my resume but whenever I see my students doing good in their life makes me happy and proud. This was an excellent experience which taught me more than just any other job could do. Peace!</strong></p>

	     <p>What happens when you don’t understand the things taught by a teacher in the class? You ask your friend to explain and then the miracle happens, the equations which were taught by a highly qualified professional didn’t get into your head but you completely grasp the whole scenario when taught by a person just like you!</p>

<p>This is not the miracle of your friend but the miracle of personalized learning. This is what university students as home tutors provide. Thus, it makes an individual learn better and grow better. Its a very helping tradition, for all the three members, the child, the tutor, and parents. The practice should be encouraged in for a better and interconnected educational society.</p>

<p>I started giving tuitions at my residence to some school going students during the four years of my engineering course. I chose the time slot of 6:30 AM to 9:30 AM and reserved the evenings for my own studies.</p>

<p>It started with just two students and soon reached 30, split into multiple batches. This was the best way where I was revising the stuff I read before, my aptitude and IQ were automatically being revised and polished, in fact, I was indirectly preparing for job interviews. Meanwhile, the fees I got was more than enough as a pocket money. I became financially independent to the most extent and was able to support my expenses including the college fees and books.</p>

<p>It helped me improve not just my IQ and aptitude but also in many other areas like- public speaking, group discussions, soft skills, self-confidence and problem-solving while exchanging questions and answers. And above all was the respect I get from my students as well as their parents. These whole things made me a job ready and guess what it also helped me ace the very first campus placement.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t mention this (“my first job experience”) on my resume but whenever I see my students doing good in their life makes me happy and proud. This was an excellent experience which taught me more than just any other job could do. Peace!</strong></p>

	     <p>I have seen few HR people on LinkedIn discussing the poor joining ratios and asking why some candidates don’t pick up their calls after the interview schedules.</p>

<p>I have a similar question to them from a candidate’s point of view, why do some companies hire candidates and never send them the offer letter?</p>

<p>Two years back I had to travel ~30 km for the Accenture interview. It was a mega drive being conducted from multiple locations for people with 2 to 11 months of experience. There were two rounds: Amcat based aptitude test followed by the technical + HR (both elimination). I was able to clear them all.</p>

<p>A few days later they confirmed my onboarding over a mail and asked to fill up the EAF form. After another few days, I was asked to upload my academic and other documents. Their portal started showing my status as pending for offer letter.</p>

<p>I waited for few weeks and when there were no further updates I wrote to them asking for the same. They replied me saying that there was no open demand matching my profile at that time and requested me to wait for some more days.</p>

<p>This whole process took 3-4 months but there was no response yet. I wrote to them again and asked whether they will send me the offer or not? They replied that they have archived my profile as per their policy and I need to reapply again. Slow Claps!</p>

<p>These same events happened to my another friend who attended this from a different location and many others whom I also know.</p>

<p>However, wasting our time must not have been their aim. So, why did they do this?</p>

<p>Was this done to get some new project showing a “virtual resource pool”, this is what I concluded.</p>

  <p>A similar type of story was narrated to me by a teacher of mine on the account of me acting an over-smart: Henceforth this &gt;story has been a torchbearer calming me and showing me my height periodically.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my words it goes like this:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Manohar and Sujata had twin kids named Buddhi and Gyani, both were five years old. On their fifth birthday celebration, Manohar discovered that his son Buddhi could dance. They appreciated his talent and motivated him to do better.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gyani was asked to concentrate on studies as he was believed to be an ordinary boy from the crowd.</p>

<p>One day Manohar’s friend Rishi with his wife visited his home. As of conventional tradition, the parents wished to showcase how smart their son was, they asked Buddhi to perform a dance. Bravo! It was a wonderful dance they all applauded with an ovation. Gyani was left unnoticed again.</p>

<p>Rishi suggested Manohar make Buddhi join a dance academy which would allow him to excel in his talent. This was a good idea, Next day Manahor took Buddhi to a renowned dance Academy;</p>

<p>He also took Gyani thinking if he too could learn a little, thus both the child got their admission.</p>

<p>A month later Manohar visited his son’s dance teacher to get the feedback. He was shocked on hearing his son’s report card. Gyani once unnoticed and assumed inferior was the best student at the Academy and Buddhi was miles behind!</p>

<p><strong>“Judge People on their Potential rather their outer appearance. The first benchers are often found lagging behind in Practical Life, and a Backbencher when mentored does better”</strong></p>

	     <p>I guess this question must have been pondering to almost every internet users. Housing.com’s Rahul Yadav has been in news for few months and I’ve been following his each update. I was curious to know how come his company worth in Millions,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“ek Website hi to hai, bas isi se itna paisa?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did a few researches and concluded with the following, let’s start with the websites first:</p>

<p>How Do Websites that don’t sell anything Makes Money?</p>

<p>People make a respectable living simply from websites by writing about topics that interest them. The first thing that comes on the way is the <strong>Traffic</strong>..</p>

<p>Traffic is the most important part of any website revenue strategy. Without traffic, your website could have the best content in the world that nobody knows about. 
Traffic in simple terms refers to the number of visitors a website receives. Now once a have a website is created, how do you generate traffic to your website?
Although there are numerous effective methods, the most popular traffic generation methods include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
SEO refers to optimizing your website for major search engines such as Google, Yahoo. To earn revenue from website, one needs to tailor his website to search engines. This allows readers to find content amidst thousands or even millions of other websites.</li>
  <li>Social Media
Social Media is a powerful tool which allows you to advertise your Website free of cost.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now Comes Making Money from All This Traffic
Once there is traffic to your website, you can actually begin to make money. Advertising is by far the best way to generate revenue from your website. Some advertising campaigns pay you just for the number of visitors coming to your site while others require that the visitor perform some action (such as make a purchase or click on a link) for you to get paid.
Most web services plan to make money by the following:</p>

<p><strong>Google AdSense</strong> - As the biggest name in search engines, Google is a great place to start earning money from your website. The AdSense campaign is free to join and places advertisements on your website based on the type of content you provide.For instance, if you own a website about Food, Google AdSense will automatically place ads related to Food. When users click on these links, you are paid. This is known as a pay-per-click or PPC campaign. Although the amount you get paid for each click may only be a few cents, if you have a large amount of traffic coming to your website, these clicks quickly add up to a respectable pay check.</p>

<p><em>Other alternatives of Google AdSense includes: Media.net, Chitika, Clicksor, Bidvertiser, Kontera
Freemium model - sell a free product and plan to convert some of them to a paid plan.
Limited period promotion - Start with the free product for a promotional initial period and plan to charge it later. For instance, 37 Signals provides free 30 day trial offer for most products and then charge if you use later. This is a tough thing to master these days.</em></p>

<p><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong> - Affiliate Marketing refers to referring a product or link on your website and earning a commission, similar to the way some people are earing mobile recharge by referring android applications to other users.</p>

<p>Selling visitors information -You visited a e-commerce website and then you notice similar or same products which you just saw are seen to you in advertisements over the web.
This is the way most ‘free’ services make money is not by selling advertising. What they sell is access to you, and information about you to advertisers, marketers and researchers, and others. Your information is the commodity that drives the internet economy. It is collected through your online actions and the information you share.
Targeted advertising model - Know as much as possible about the user and bring targeted ads. Eg. Facebook and Google.
Sponsorship model - If your service indirectly helps the government and/or major organizations, you could ask them to sponsor your service.
Wikipedia model - You could get donations from your users. Many wordpress plugins, open source tools, and Wikipedia do this. This could be the future of newspapers.
Open Source Model - Sell the product for free and plan to make money on support, customization, and installation. Most open source software follows this model.
Usage charge model - This is related to the freemium model. Give the product free for low usage, but charge when the user is exceeding the free limits (many storage applications such as Dropbox fall under this).</p>
